# Official-School-Site

This repository contains the complete website I built for my former school. The site includes pages for announcements, school information, events, and contact details. It is designed to be clean, modern, and easy to navigate.

Features:

1. Responsive design for desktop & mobile
2. Modern UI with clean layout
3. Information pages (About, Academics, Events, Contact)
4. Easy-to-update structure
5. Fast-loading static site

The goal was to create a simple yet professional website that enhances communication and provides essential information for students, parents, and visitors.
